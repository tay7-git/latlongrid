<H1 CLASS="western">Latitude / longitude grid lines plugin</H1>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Lat/Lon grid plugin is designed to add grid lines to the QGIS
project. It uses extent of some other GIS layer (vector or raster) to
compute limits of the grid. This &ldquo;parent&rdquo; layer can be as
simple as two point features and may not be even visible.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Lat/Lon plugin does not allow adding grid lines to other plugin
layers, such as Open Layers.</P>
<P>New grid layer is created entirely in memory, i.e grid lines are
not saved into shape file or other type of GIS vector file.</P>
<P>Grid lines are <B>always</B> created in geographical coordinate
system. For this reason &ldquo;project on the fly&rdquo; option is
always need to be enabled to use that layer (see Project / Project
properties... menu).</P>
<P>If parent layer uses geographic coordinate system Lat/Lon plugin
layer simply uses the same system. If parent layer uses some kind of
projected CRS (such as GeoTIFF file in UTM) than Lat/Lon plugin
computes inverse transformation and uses inverted extend of the the
parent layer.  
</P>
<P>All plugin layer settings are saved into QGIS project.</P>
<P>The main dialog window of Lat/Lon plugin is shown below:</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="lat_lon_plugin.jpg" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=383 HEIGHT=334 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Use should do the following:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Select parent layer. Dialog presents only suitable layers for
	selection. If no layer is available warning message is posted and
	plugin does not start.</P>
	<LI><P>Select grid label format. Decimal degrees, degrees and
	minutes and degrees minutes and seconds are available for selection.</P>
	<LI><P>Specify grid spacing for latitude and longitude grid. These
	values are specified in the least unit selected above. Therefore if
	user selects units as &ldquo;decimal degrees&rdquo; grid line
	spacing is spcified in decimal degrees as well, if user selects
	&ldquo;degrees and minutes&rdquo; than spacing is in minites, and if
	&ldquo;degrees, minutes and seconds&rdquo; is selected that spacing
	is in seconds. Spacing labels change depending of selected format.</P>
	<LI><P>Labels. Check where labels should be printed. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Label orientation: Labels could be perpendicular or parallel
	to the area. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Font, color and grid line style allows to select required
	appearance for the grid lines and labels.</P>
</OL>
<P>After  Lat/Lon grid overlay added to the project, user can
double-click or call &ldquo;propreties&rdquo; dialog for it; the same
dialog as above is called, so it is always possible to adjust grid
after it is created. 
</P>
<P>If parent layer extent is changed, grid extent is adjusted
automatically.</P>
<P>If parent layer is removed, grid layer is removed as well.

<P STYLE="font-style: normal">This plugin was developed using &ldquo;Grid
Overlay&rdquo; by John Donovan, available for QGIS 1.8 series. I have
borrowed many ideas and some code from John's plugin. However
labeling API has changed for QGIS 2.0. There is a possibility that
Lat/lon grid plugin would become outdated as QGIS labeling  engine is
being replaced.</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal">This is my first Python program, so not
all places are nice.
